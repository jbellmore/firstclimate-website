description: "A form of emissions trading that countries utilize in order to meet their obligations to limit carbon dioxide. A country with greater emissions of carbon is able to purchase the right to emit additional carbon while a country with less emissions can trade the right to emit less. The Kyoto Protocol utilizes this method in order to meet carbon obligations."
